# Aus-Mon Website Project

## Introduction

The emerging Mongolian Community is a new diverse and enriching cultural addition to the Bayside Community. As the Mongolian Community is new to Bayside, language and cultural differences have been a strong barrier for the Mongolian people to access their community to socialise, engage, and celebrate their culture, diversity, and language that they can share inclusively with the Bayside Community. We believe that providing a website that offers dual language access that delivers information for and about both the Mongolian and Australian Communities helps the community overcome barriers. Aus-Mon CSDI will develop the website under the “Mongolian Website Project” financed by “Doing It Differently” Bayside Grants Projects from 1 September 2021 to 03 November 2021.

## Objective

This project aims to develop a dual language website that will ensure the Mongolian Community has access to health, mental health, lifestyle, events, social services, other professional services and opportunities.

It will create a space for the Mongolian Community to access Australian communities' support, resources, and opportunities. The website will be a reliable, primary information source for the Mongolian Community to access council, state and federal information, services, support and legislation.

## Consumers

We intend to strengthen and connect the Mongolian Community with Australian Communities by providing a dual-language website. And primary consumers will be Mongolians living in Australia and planning to come to Australia soon. In addition, Australian organisations and communities can use the website to communicate Mongolian community and distribute information among Mongolians in Australia.

## Tech Stack

The goal is to use full-stack Javascript that makes it easier for beginners.

- Front-End - [React](https://reactjs.org/) using create-react-app framework
- Backend (CMS) - [Keystone.js](https://keystonejs.com/) or equivalient - but initially [markdowns to HTML pages](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) could work.
- Hosting - AWS cloud services. e.g. S3, EC2 and RDS etc.
